This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# React Charts with D3
My main motivation for this project was remove my dependence on charting frameworks I've used in the past and make reusable chart components with React and D3.

## Current Todo Items
1.  Add config parsing to csv parser
2.  Text wrapping built-in to axis rendering
3.  Legend configuration and rendering
4.  Annotation support
5.  More chart types!
